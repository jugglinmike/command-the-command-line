1. Recall from :chapter:command-invocation: that when we run the command `echo
   ~`, the shell steps in and replaces the `~` with a path to the current
   user's "home" directory. What do you expect will happen when we run the
   command `sudo echo ~`? Run that command. Did the output match your
   expectation?
