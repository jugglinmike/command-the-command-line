1. Recall from :chapter:command-invocation: that when we run the command `echo
   ~`, the shell steps in and replaces the `~` with a path to the current
   user's "home" directory. What do you expect will happen when we run the
   command `sudo echo ~`?
2. What does `sudo sudo whoami` mean? Are there any reasons to use `sudo` twice
   like that?
