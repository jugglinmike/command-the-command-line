This chapter has yet to be completed.

Unix-like systems have a built-in understanding of "users." Although these were
originally intended to describe individual people interacting with the system
through remote terminals, user accounts are today used for many other purposes.
A typical Unix-like system will have many "system users" that no one ever logs
in to and that don't even have a "home" directory.

In general, you can think of a user as a set of rules about what may and may
not be done on a computer. When a human being logs in to that user account,
they will be bound by those rules. Alternatively, an automated task (perhaps
repeated on some regular interval) could be assigned to such a set of rules.
