???

Spend enough time on a Unix-like system and you will stumble across the "root"
directories. The typical hierarchy is an intimidating tree of strangely-named
directories with inscrutable purposes.

---

```terminal
vm$ cat fhs.txt
    bin/       usr/            var/
    boot/         bin/            account/
    dev/          include/        cache/
    etc/          lib/            crash/
    home/         local/          games/
    lib/             bin/         lib/
    media/           lib/         lock/
    mnt/             sbin/        log/
    opt/          sbin/           mail/
    root/         share/          opt/
    run/          src/            run/
    sbin/                         spool/
    srv/                          tmp/
    tmp/
vm$ 
```

???

Some names are repeated (`/bin/`, `/usr/bin/`, and `/usr/local/bin/`), others
seem vague (`/media/` or `/etc/`), and still others sound more appropriate for
a mechanical device than a computer (`/run/`, `/var/lock/`).

This chapter is an overview that explores the significance of each directory
for a system administrator. As with the rest of this course, the aim is to
provide a working knowledge of this nuanced topic.

???

Just like so many aspects of Unix-like systems, the file system hierarchy we
see today evolved over the course of many years. It was influenced both by
legitimate technical constraints (some of which that are no longer relevant)
and the disparate whims of siloed developers.

**The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard** (FHS) is a document that attempts to
recognize the meaningful conventions between Unix-like systems and define a
normalized structure. It is maintained by [the Linux
Foundation](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/) and *not* [the Open
Group](http://www.opengroup.org/), so it is not part of POSIX nor a requirement
to qualify for the Unix trademark. It is, however, widely observed by Unix-like
system distributors and administrators.

# Framing: Primary User

```terminal
1. Directories used by the system itself
2. Directories used by applications
3. Directories used by administrators
```

???

We will discuss these directories in terms of their primary user. This
distinction is not perfect, though: many directories have more than one
use-case. Even so, this framework makes for a helpful lens to view the whole
tree.

# System Directories

```terminal
vm$ cat fhs-system.txt
  * = directories for system use

    bin/       usr/            var/
  * boot/         bin/            account/
  * dev/          include/        cache/
    etc/          lib/            crash/
    home/         local/          games/
    lib/             bin/         lib/
    media/           lib/         lock/
    mnt/             sbin/        log/
    opt/             share/       mail/
    root/         sbin/           opt/
    run/          share/          run/
    sbin/                         spool/
    srv/                          tmp/
    tmp/
vm$ 
```

???

The system controls a few of the directories:

- `/boot/` - short for **boot loader**; contains the files required to start
  the system
- `/dev/` - short for **device**; contains the system's device files

Only in rare circumstances will an administrator need to manage these
directories.

---

:continued:

- `/dev/null` - reading never returns data, writing has no effect; useful for
  silencing "noisy" commands
- `/dev/urandom` - returns random bytes

# Administrative Directories

```terminal
vm$ cat fhs-admin.txt
  * = directories for administrators

    bin/       usr/            var/
    boot/         bin/            account/
    dev/          include/        cache/
    etc/          lib/            crash/
  * home/       * local/          games/
    lib/             bin/         lib/
  * media/           lib/         lock/
  * mnt/             sbin/        log/
  * opt/             share/       mail/
  * root/         sbin/           opt/
    run/          share/          run/
    sbin/                         spool/
    srv/                          tmp/
    tmp/
vm$ 
```

???

- `/home/` - stores directories dedicated to individual user accounts; creating
  a new user often entails creating a sub-directory of `/home/`
- `/media/` - mounted file systems for removable media
- `/mnt/` - a mount point intended for temporary use
- `/opt/` - software packages installed by the administrator; specifically
  installed within self-contained sub-directories, eschewing the
  recommendations of the FHS; "package manager" applications generally install
  software across the
  filesystem according to the recommendations of the FHS (e.g. within `/usr/`
  or `/usr/local/`)
- `/root/` - the root user's "HOME" directory
- `/usr/local/` - software packages installed by the administrator; follows the
  same conventions of distribution-provided software (e.g. `bin/`, `sbin/`,
  `lib/`, and `share/`)

# Application Directories

```terminal
vm$ cat fhs-applications.txt
  * = directories for application use

  * bin/       usr/          * var/
    boot/       * bin/            account/
    dev/        * include/        cache/
  * etc/        * lib/            crash/
    home/         local/          games/
  * lib/             bin/         lib/
    media/           lib/         lock/
    mnt/             sbin/        log/
    opt/             share/       mail/
    root/       * sbin/           opt/
    run/        * share/          run/
  * sbin/                         spool/
    srv/                          tmp/
  * tmp/
vm$ 
```

???

- `/bin/`, `/usr/bin/` - short for **bin**aries; executable binaries; intended
  for general-purpose use
- `/etc/` - short for **et c**etera; configuration files
- `/lib/`, `/usr/lib/` - short for **lib**raries; compiled library code
- `/usr/include/` - compiled "header" files
- `/sbin/`, `/usr/sbin/` - short for **s**ystem **bin**aries; executable
  binaries; intended for system
  administrators
- `/tmp/` - temporary files
- `/var/` - short for **var**iable; data files (e.g. no code) that are intended
  to change without system administrator intervention

---

:continued:

System administrators regularly interact with many of the files created by
applications.

- `/etc/` - modify the behavior of system services like web servers (e.g.
  `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`, `/etc/apache2/sites-available/`)
- `/tmp/` - useful for certain scripting tasks; see the `mktemp` utility for a
  safe way to interact with this directory
- `/bin/`, `/sbin/`, `/usr/bin/`, `/usr/sbin/` - executable files intended for
  general use; these directories should be in your `PATH` environment variable
  (see :chapter:customization:)
- `/var/log/` - process log files; essential for troubleshooting; see the
  `tail` utility for a way to read the final lines of a file (especially as
  more lines are added over time)

# Application Distinctions: Start-up time

Some of the directories names in the "root" directory are also present in
`/usr/`, namely `bin/`, `sbin/`, and `lib/`.

The size of the file system mounted on the "root" directory can effect system
start-up time. Historically, the time to start up could be significantly
reduced by deferring the loading of some binaries. Placing non-essential
binaries within a dedicated directory (`/sbin/`) allowed for that.

Today, the time savings enabled by this optimization are greatly reduced, and
many applications no longer honor the distinction. [There is a movement to make
these directories one and the
same.](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/TheCaseForTheUsrMerge/)

# Application Distinctions: Admin vs. user

Some tools are really only appropriate for system administrators. None of the
POSIX-defined utilities fit this description, but common administrative
applications include `adduser` (for creating new users), `cron` (for scheduling
commands), and `fdisk` (for managing partitions). In defining dedicated
directories for each "type" of executable, the FHS makes it easier for
developers and administrators to label and protect the more dangerous tools.

This is the motivation for the `bin/` and `sbin/` directories, as available
within the "root" directory, within `/usr/`, and within `/usr/local/`.

# Application Distinctions: Installer

POSIX-defined utilities can be considered inherent to the system and available
in all Unix-like environments. If a system includes any additional application,
then that application must have been installed by some authority. The authority
may be a so-called "distribution" (e.g. Apple Inc. in the case of OSX or the
maintainers of Ubuntu in the case of Ubuntu GNU/Linux). It may also be an
administrator of the local system.

Understanding the identity of the software's installer makes it easier to
reason across systems of the same distribution (e.g. knowing that all Debian
installations include the `adduser` utility) and within specific systems (e.g.
discovering that a particular Debian installation has the `ansible` application
installed).

The FHS encourages systems to make this distinction by installing software to
either `/usr/` or `/usr/local/`.

# In Review

- The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard is an attempt to unify conventions that
  have evolved over many years and across many Unix-like distributions
- Some of the directories are intended for system use and do not need to be
  inspected during routine operation
- Some of the directories are intended to facilitate system maintenance
- The majority of the directories are defined according to the needs of
  software applications; familiarity with these directories allows an
  administrator to configure and troubleshoot
